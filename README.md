### Hi there, I'm Jenita! 👋
I'm a Computer Science and Business student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University 🎓. From my choice in education, you can probably tell I've always had a passion for the intersection between technology 🤖 and business 💼. This is what led me to find a love for Product Management work, and developing my skills in Product Design, Full-Stack Development, and Entrepreneurship. I'd love to connect on LinkedIn and I'm always available to chat about anything tech, product or career. Thanks for stopping by my Github!
